Hello there 🙂 I am Ashwin – an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University double majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. I work as a researcher at Cleveland Clinic, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Professor [Carl Saab](https://www.saablab.com) on EEG Predictive Models.

My research interests focus on understanding and improving the inner workings of modern AI systems:

1. **Interpretability:** How do models internally represent concepts and abstractions, and how do they deploy these representations to solve complex tasks?

2. **Scientific Reasoning:** How do we build autonomous models capable of advanced reasoning and meaningful scientific discovery?

3. **Alignment/Safety:** How do we ensure that increasingly capable systems behave reliably, faithfully, and in alignment with human goals and intentions?

See [Ideas](https://ashwinsaras.github.io/teaching) for open research questions and recent papers I’ve enjoyed thinking about
